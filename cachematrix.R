## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" 
## object that can cache its inverse.

## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special 
## "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", 
## which is really a list containing a function to 
# 1.set the value of the matrix
# 2.get the value of the matrix
# 3.set the value of the Inverse
# 4.get the value of the Inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setmatrix <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getmatrix <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setmatrix = setmatrix,
       getmatrix = getmatrix)
}

## The following function calculates the Inverse of the special "matrix" 
## created with the above function. 
## However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. 
## If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. 
## Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the matrix and 
## sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setmatrix function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  
  m <- x$getmatrix()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached matrix inverse")
    return(m)
  }
  ##calculate  inverse of matrix and set it
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setmatrix(m)
  m
}
